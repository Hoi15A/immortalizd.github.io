Ayy, it's Immo here and I've created something (mom, get the camera).
If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to give them to me!

Technical limitations:
I don't know JavaScript, but I'm trying to learn it. Don't expect me to be awesome at it though.
I'm also not a god when it comes to CSS and HTML.

It is what it is, and it is basic.

Also, if you want to contribute, send me a PM. Links are [here](http://immortalizd.github.io/index.html).
